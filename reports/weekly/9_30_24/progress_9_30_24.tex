    \section{Project Overview}\label{sec:project-overview}
    Large Language Model (LLM) power consumption is increasingly problematic for datacenters, with \textit{The Electric Power
    Research Institute} forecasting that data centers may see their electricity consumption double by
    2030~\cite{kindig2024}.

    Optimizing these models is key to reducing power consumption.
    The cornerstone of optimization is determining what you need, and what you don't: determine the importance of
    aspects and components of the system, enabling you to perform systematic optimization with certainty.
    In Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), the atomic unit of these components is the artificial neuron.
    To optimize an ANN, understanding the sensitivity of the neuron to changes in its input and parameters is paramount,
    but the sheer size and complexity of LLMs makes this incredibly challenging.

    Thus, the goal of this research is to:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Understand current methodologies for determining neuron sensitivity in LLMs.
        \item Explore improvements that can be made to more accurately and more efficiently determine neuron sensitivity in
        LLMs.
    \end{enumerate}

    The intent is that this research will be a first step towards innovating and improving optimizations for LLMs,
    reducing power consumption and enabling the models to run on lower powered hardware.
